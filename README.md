# MultiverSegSlicer

## Installation

- Drag and drop the [`SegmentEditorMultiverSeg`](./SegmentEditorMultiverSeg) folder into slicer
- Restart
- The new segment effect should be visible in the segmentation tools
- _Note: The first time you click on the `initialize` button, slicer will prompt you to download all the dependecies/files/extension needed. It can take some time installing everything._

## Managing Contexts

For the moment, it is not possible to delete examples from a context through slicer.
To do so, go to [`./SegmentEditorMultiverSeg/Context`](./SegmentEditorMultiverSeg/Context)
to see the context and their content. It is possible to delete individual example from there, and to inspect the context content.
